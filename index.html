    <p>Welcome!, I am Diantong, a senior undergraduate student at <a href="https://cuhk.edu.cn/">The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen</a>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I major in Statistics.</li>
        <li>I wrote this page with Markdown converted to HTML (painlessly).</li>
        <li>I enjoy creating things: I <a href = "gallery.html">draw</a>. I write short stories.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Research Interest</h2>
    <p>My research interest lies in data-driven decision-making methods, such as Bayesian Optimization. I am currently working on few-shot Bayesian Optimization with knowledge transfer facilitated by pre-trained transformers.</p>
